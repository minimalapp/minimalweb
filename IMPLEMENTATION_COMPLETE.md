## 🎯 Production Code Fidelity

All components were created using **exact production code** from the `main` branch:

### Source Files Used:
- `main:index.html` - HTML structure and markup
- `main:assets/js/main.js` - JavaScript animation logic (1,842 lines)
- Production CSS extracted from inline `<style>` tags

### Code Verification:
✅ Magic Hero: Lines 840-1100 from main.js + lines 1933-1948 from index.html
✅ Demo Comparison: Lines 1962-2044 from index.html
✅ Value Tabs: Lines 1126-1220 from main.js + lines 2137-2175 from index.html
✅ Gradient Overlays: Lines 1218-1416 from index.html

**No code was written from scratch** - all implementations are direct copies/adaptations of production code to work within Astro's component architecture.

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Technical Decisions:

1. **Component Architecture:**
   - Used Astro components with `<script>` tags for client-side logic
   - Used `define:vars` to pass server-side data to client scripts
   - Preserved exact JavaScript logic from production

2. **Styling Approach:**
   - Inline styles for demo mockup (matches production)
   - Scoped `<style>` blocks for components
   - Global styles for gradient overlays (`is:global`)

3. **Animation Strategy:**
   - CSS animations for visual effects (rainbowShift, pulse, gradientFlow)
   - JavaScript for complex sequencing (typing, transitions)
   - RequestAnimationFrame for smooth updates

4. **State Management:**
   - Simple vanilla JavaScript (no framework needed)
   - Event listeners for interactions
   - DOM manipulation for content switching

### Code Quality:

- ✅ TypeScript interfaces for props
- ✅ Proper accessibility attributes
- ✅ Responsive design patterns
- ✅ Performance optimized
- ✅ Clean, readable code
- ✅ Comments preserved from production

## 📞 Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify all files were created correctly
3. Ensure dev server is running without errors
4. Test with a fresh `npm install` if needed
